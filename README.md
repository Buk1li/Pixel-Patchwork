# Pixel Patchwork

## Description
This website allows users to place pixels one at a time to collaboratively make pixel art. Users can pay a one time fee to unlock a premium account to access faster pixel placement. It also features a live chat that allows users to coordinate their pixel art efforts. Made using React, Material UI, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.io, Apollo, GraphQL, and Stripe.

## Usage
Click sign up to create an account and then click on the canvas to change the color of a pixel. You will not be able to place a pixel again for 30 seconds.
